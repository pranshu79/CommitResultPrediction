# Convolve(Epoch-2)

We have multiple Problem Statements in this epoch out of which we have to chose any one and must continue with that PS for rest of the competition. The submissions will be carefully evaluated by the organizing team and best few teams will proceed to next epoch.

## [Problem Statement](https://github.com/pranshu79/CommitResultPrediction/blob/main/Problem%20Statement%202.pdf)
